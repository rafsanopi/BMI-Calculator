The BMI app developed with Flutter is a health and fitness tool that enables users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight and height. The app features an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to obtain their BMI and understand its significance. By categorizing the BMI into underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, the app helps users gauge their health status and set fitness goals. Additionally, it promotes awareness about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight.
